# Design_Single-Cycle-MIPS32-ISA-Custom-Processor

This project is a Verilog-based implementation of a single-cycle CPU architecture adhering to the MIPS32 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is part of a personal initiative to strengthen understanding in computer architecture and RTL design.

> This project was undertaken as a personal learning initiative to deepen my understanding of processor architecture, digital design, and the MIPS32 instruction set.  
> The goal was to implement a functional single-cycle processor entirely in Verilog, simulating core components such as instruction decoding, register file handling, memory operations, and ALU computations.  
> Through this project, I successfully developed a working MIPS32 processor capable of executing a variety of basic R-type and I-type instructions.  
> This hands-on experience significantly enhanced my practical knowledge of computer architecture, RTL design, and the functional flow of instruction execution in a CPU.

## üîßExtension of Existing Architecture for Jump Instruction Support

To extend the processor's instruction set, the architecture was modified to implement support for the **jump (j)** instruction.

### üóÇ Location of Modified Design

The updated architecture and Verilog source code with jump instruction support can be found in the following folder:  
`/My Modified Architecture`

### ‚úÖ Results

These modifications enabled successful execution of programs containing jump (`j`) instructions, verified by correct operation and waveform validation.


## üß± Architecture 

This processor was designed based on the standard single-cycle MIPS32 architecture shown below. All modules (PC, ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Data Memory, etc.) strictly adhere to this structure.

- **Program Counter (PC):** Holds address of the current instruction.
- **Instruction Memory:** Outputs 32-bit instruction at the PC address.
- **Instruction Decoder:** Extracts fields (opcode, rs, rt, rd, shamt, funct).
- **Control Unit:** Generates control signals based on opcode.
- **Register File:** Reads two registers, writes to one.
- **Sign-Extend:** Converts 16-bit immediate to 32-bit signed value.
- **ALU Control:** Decodes `funct` with `ALUOp` to control ALU operation.
- **ALU:** Performs arithmetic/logical operations.
- **Data Memory:** Load/store operations based on control signals.
- **Multiplexers (MUX):** Select paths for register destination, ALU operand, memory result, and PC update.
- **Shift Left 2 & Branch Adder:** Used for branch address computation.
- **Branch Logic:** Determines branch condition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Simulation Instructions

1. Open Vivado or any Verilog simulator.
2. Add all `.v` modules and `testbench.v`.
3. Set `testbench.v` as the top module.
4. Run behavioral simulation.
5. Inspect waveform to verify expected register/memory values.


## ‚úÖ Result

The single-cycle MIPS32 processor was successfully built and verified. It executes test programs with correct instruction flow and data manipulation, supporting essential instruction types with full memory/register interfacing.
