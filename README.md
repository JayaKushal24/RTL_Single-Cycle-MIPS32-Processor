This project is a Verilog-based implementation of a single-cycle CPU architecture adhering to the MIPS32 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It is part of a personal initiative to strengthen understanding in computer architecture and RTL design.

## üß† Overview

The processor executes MIPS32 instructions in a single clock cycle per instruction. It supports R-type, I-type, memory (lw/sw), and branching (beq) instructions. Simulation waveforms and test programs verify its correctness.

## üß± Architecture 

This processor was designed based on the standard single-cycle MIPS32 architecture shown below. All modules (PC, ALU, Register File, Control Unit, Data Memory, etc.) strictly adhere to this structure.

- **Program Counter (PC):** Holds address of the current instruction.
- **Instruction Memory:** Outputs 32-bit instruction at the PC address.
- **Instruction Decoder:** Extracts fields (opcode, rs, rt, rd, shamt, funct).
- **Control Unit:** Generates control signals based on opcode.
- **Register File:** Reads two registers, writes to one.
- **Sign-Extend:** Converts 16-bit immediate to 32-bit signed value.
- **ALU Control:** Decodes `funct` with `ALUOp` to control ALU operation.
- **ALU:** Performs arithmetic/logical operations.
- **Data Memory:** Load/store operations based on control signals.
- **Multiplexers (MUX):** Select paths for register destination, ALU operand, memory result, and PC update.
- **Shift Left 2 & Branch Adder:** Used for branch address computation.
- **Branch Logic:** Determines branch condition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Simulation Instructions

1. Open Vivado or any Verilog simulator.
2. Add all `.v` modules and `testbench.v`.
3. Set `testbench.v` as the top module.
4. Run behavioral simulation.
5. Inspect waveform to verify expected register/memory values.
