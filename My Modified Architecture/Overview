The standard Architecture doesnt handle the Jump Instrcutions.
so i modified the architecture a bit.

on top of the existing arch, 

    A)i created a module named JUMP , where 
          jump_address = { PC_plus_4[31:28], instruction[25:0], 2'b00 };
        (expalantion for this is given in my documentation)

    B)i added a another mux in top level and instatiated the jump module..
        1.the out of jump module goes to input 1 of mux and input 0 is pc+4 wire
        2.the slect line for this comes from control block..so i modifed the control module to suport this..
        3. the ouput of this goes to the pc_mux as input0.

     C)Control Module:  opcode is added for jump instr..upon identifying jump is set to 1. if not then 0.
